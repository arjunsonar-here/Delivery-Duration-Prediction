PROJECT :- Delivery Duration Prediction for DoorDash.

Bussiness Problem :

When a consumer places an order on DoorDash,It shows the expected time of delivery. It is very important for DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. Here we are building and evaluating various models to predict the estimated time taken for a delivery.

Contents of Project :-

- Importing Library
- Loading data
- Data Preprocessing & Visualization
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

Data Description :-

The attached file historical_data.csv contains a subset of deliveries received at DoorDash in early 2015 in a subset of the cities.

The notebook focuses on the delivery time for orders on the DoorDash Application from data found on Stratscratch.My work in this notebook focused on creating a model post analysis in order to foresay the time an order is going to take to reach a client based on a bunch of features you will learn more about below.

Steps Involved in Model building:- 

- Assigning values to features as X and target as y
- Split test and training sets
- Fitting 6 different models(3 linear and basic and 3 ensemble   models) in search for the model with the best mean squared error   and R2 score

ENHANCMENTS IN THE MODEL AFTER UPDATION :-

* The most well performed model was Random Forest with R2 Score of   91% which eariler was 83%.

* The Model Performance increased by 12% for Linear Regression from earlier analysis.

* Aslo tried with other models as well but they underperformed you can see all the outputs in the below code.

Feel Free to provide suggestions (will love to hear) and try to apply other methods at as well for increasing the accuracy of the model
